## Projects

- [RedisQ](https://github.com/whynotmax/RedisQ): A simple minecraft server queue system built with gradle and redisson. 1.19+
- [password-strength-checker](https://github.com/whynotmax/password-strength-checker): The "password-strength-checker" is a Python tool that evaluates password strength based on multiple criteria to help users create more secure passwords.
- [LibraryManagementSystem](https://github.com/whynotmax/LibraryManagementSystem): Simple console interface for libraries built in Java. It's around two years old as I used it for learning purposes.
- mcrealms.gg: My own minehut oriented approach with own minigames. Users can create custom realms, install mods and or plugins, and more. This will be a private project for now, yet to decide if I want to make it public or not.
- SkySlayer: Around since mid 2018. SkyPvP / CityBuild server. Started at version 1.8.8, now recoding it to 1.20.4+. Project will not be public, as I intend to release this server. [Click here to join the discord](https://discord.gg/4zXkgYUuue).
